# NIST Method Pkg files

## **What is delivered?**
* Methods (pkg files) for the Semi Automated Passaging, Seeding and Maintenance, of the Allen cell collection of hiPSC lines 
  expressing green fluorescent protein tagged to protein identifying specific cellular organelles and structures. 
* You will find the instructions for the import in the folder.  We have just updated our computer from windows 7 to windows 10 
  so the methods should be compatible with the latest version of Venus and associated drivers.  
  If you need assistance when importing and opening due to needed driver and/or library please contact Ben Gregor at beng@alleninstitute.org 
  or your local Hamilton applications person should be able to help you as well.
